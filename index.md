# Welcome to [Jeanne, Cherrière, Daby-Seesaram, CSMA]'s demos!

This is the work Octave Jeanne did during his internship between GEEPS and LMS in 2025. The goal of this paper is to provide a proof of concept of the use of the Finite element Neural Network interpolation framework for topology optimisation of magnetostatic machines.
