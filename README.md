# NeuROM_optim_demo
This is the work Octave Jeanne did during his internship under the supervision of Théodore Cherrière (GEEPS) and Alexandre Daby-Seesaram (LMS) in 2025. The goal of this paper is to provide a proof of concept of the use of the Finite element Neural Network interpolation framework for topology optimisation of magnetostatic machines.
